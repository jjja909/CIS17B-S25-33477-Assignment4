Once Compiled and ran, the program will create a storage manager that holds items using both methods allowing for a sorted list and fast lookup. 
1. It adds 2 sample items,
2. Then tries adding duplicates, 
3. Then retrieves one item by ID,
4. Then it attempts to remove a nonexisten item,
5. Then it lists all remaining items
6. and lastly runs a test checking the duplicate trigger and missing ID trigger.
